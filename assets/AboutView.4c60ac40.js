But some people are using it as a ways to pave their way to the life. Our sun sign is the one everybody knows because it&#39;s the one that depends on your birthday. It&#39;s the most important one because it shows the conscious mind of someone. It shows our creative forc&quot;e and our will to live. The sun sign is the one who rules our personnality. </p></div><div class="col" data-v-6e0470ea><img src="'+c+'" alt="" data-v-6e0470ea></div><div class="col" data-v-6e0470ea><h4 data-v-6e0470ea>About Aurora</h4><p data-v-6e0470ea>Aurora has been created by Anne-Sophie.

Aurora means <span class="dawn" data-v-6e0470ea>&quot;the dawn&quot;</span>. It&#39;s a natural light that we can see in the morning. It was then obvious for that site to follow the name and be called Aurora.
